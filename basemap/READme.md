## Connor Ouellette, 12/3/2019, Courthouse Rock

For my field work project I selected Courthouse Rock in the Red River Gorge. The Courthouse Rock Trail is located in Powell County, Kentucky. The trail is 2.25 miles with a dirt and sand surface. The Courthouse Rock Trail is located within a loop on the Auxier Ridge Trail.
